        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Uniquely Strange Caregivers was founded by a group of healthcare and social work professionals who saw a need for more personalized home care in Houston. We’ve cared for our own loved ones and understand the importance of finding the right fit. Our services grew from a passion to celebrate every person’s individuality while helping them live life on their terms.</p>
        <p>We’ve hand‑picked a team of caregivers who share our values. Each caregiver is vetted, trained and supported so they can deliver the high level of care your family deserves.</p>
