        <h2>Home Care Assistance</h2>
        <p>Our caregivers provide daily living assistance to help clients remain independent at home. This includes personal care (bathing, grooming), medication reminders, meal preparation, light housekeeping, transportation to appointments and meaningful companionship. We understand the importance of trust and consistency, which is why we match you with a caregiver who fits your family’s personality and needs.</p>

        <h2>Respite & Relief Care</h2>
        <p>Family caregivers deserve rest and support. Our respite services are designed to give you time for self‑care, work or errands while ensuring your loved one receives excellent care. We can fill in for a few hours, overnight or on a regular schedule – whatever you need to maintain balance and avoid burnout.</p>
